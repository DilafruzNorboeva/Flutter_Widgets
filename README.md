Code Explanation
GreetingWidget (lib/greeting_widget.dart)
This file defines a StatelessWidget named GreetingWidget. It takes a greeting message as a parameter and displays it using a Text widget.

CounterWidget (lib/counter_widget.dart)
This file defines a StatefulWidget named CounterWidget. It displays a counter and includes a button to increment the counter. The counter value is managed using the setState method.

main.dart
The main.dart file in the lib/ directory is the entry point for the application. It showcases the usage of both GreetingWidget and CounterWidget. The MyApp class is a StatelessWidget that creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a Column with instances of GreetingWidget and CounterWidget.
